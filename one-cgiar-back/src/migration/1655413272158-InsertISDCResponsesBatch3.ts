The findings from this gender analysis will help identify levers  of change to contribute to gender equality through the initiative activities  and will inform the gender-responsive implementation of each work package  through the integration of specific activities and approaches. For example,  for WP2 a better understanding of the existing gender gap in accessing to  digital tools and ensuring that agroclimatic information is easily accessible  for both men and women in farming households and responds to their interests  and priorities. For WP3 and WP4, we will be able to identify different  barriers to access to extension services and to the uptake of innovative  technologies and inform the design of training materials and formats. Beyond empowerment, our inclusion approach directly  addresses&nbsp;gender and  marginalized groups in agriculture. The stakeholder process and capacity  building engage both men and women in shifting gender relations to better  enable women’s agency and innovation. In the design phase, current norms  within households, communities, and institutions regarding women’s roles in  local agri-food systems and mechanisms available to women for pursuing  innovation will be assessed<a href='#_ftn3' name='_ftnref3' title=''>[3]</a>.&nbsp;The  implementation phase will deliver for women and marginal groups, armed  with knowledge of barriers (e.g. labor demands; gaps in knowledge, tools, and  finance), opportunities (e.g. women-specific training; market linkages), and  tradeoffs. The initiative will intervene in restrictive gender norms by:  building women’s managerial and technical competencies; normalizing women as  decision makers within households and extended families; increasing  recognition of women as farmers among extension, local government,  agro-dealers, and finance institutions.  <br>  ",

Such partnerships have  been built through strong social capital, which entails not only their  ownership of the joint efforts but CGIAR’s permanent acknowledge of partners’  capacities and contributions to the achievements made. This will remain and  grow through AgriLAC Resiliente as collaboration, cooperation and trust are  key pillars of our integrated approach across all five work packages. In  addition, thorough coordination through constant dialogue and effective  internal communication channels between work packages will enable a coherent  approach to local partners. AgriLAC Resiliente will also coordinate with  OneCGIAR Regional Office and the country conveners to seek alignment and  coherence to manage strategic partnerships across the region and with the  GTIs involved in LAC. The partnership strategy is supported by the IASI  methodology. A shared vision for thriving, climate-resilient crop and  livestock-based agri-food systems by engaging multi-sectoral stakeholders and  partners will be co-build, followed by a tactical plan based on a  multi-sectoral planning process along with all work packages emphasizing on  the integration of production (farmers and farmer organization) and demand  (private sector and public purchasing) and inclusive value chains and the partnerships  required for this. Finally, the implementation of the tactical plan through  the InnovaHubs which will embed and harvest nutrition-sensitive  socioecological technical innovations from AgriLAC Resiliente’s work packages  and GTIs.  <br>  ",

Due to these  pressures, a re-design of the current food system is needed urgently to drive  stability, ensure food security, reduce rural poverty, and achieve economic  and social sustainability. Its impacts, especially on food insecurity, social  and economic instability, natural resource stresses and environmental  degradation, and the associated conflicts are projected to start intensifying  soon requiring urgent and decisive actions (<a href='https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/#FullReport'>IPCC,  2021</a>; <a href='http://visionofhumanity.org/reports'>Economic  Intelligence Unit, 2020</a>; Waha et al., 2017; <a href='http://hdl.handle.net/10986/26207'>Sadoff  et al., 2017</a>; <a href='https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1116304109'>Kaniewski et al, 2012</a><u>;</u> <a href='https://www.iai.it/sites/default/files/menara_wp_3.pdf'>McKee et al., 2017</a>, <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2011.01.006'>García-Ruiz  et al., 2011</a>). Whilst a degree of intra-regional  variability exists, the region, which already faces declining per capita  water availability, is generally expected to become increasingly arid and has  recently experienced a 15-year drying period including the 2007-2010 drought,  which some research has suggested is the worst drought in the region in the  past nine centuries (Gray, 2016). Most lands within the MENA region receive less  than 300 mm of annual rainfall, with semi-arid belts along the coasts and  mountains providing the only productive lands for rain-fed agriculture (<a href='https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0143-4'>Immerzeel et al., 2011</a>).

Interacting  with already fragile settings characterized by underlying socio-political  tensions and grievances, climatic factors may act as a risk multiplier,  creating the conditions in which multiple degrees of fragility become  compounded (<a href='https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/117616'>Laderach  et al, 2022</a>).  <br>  Given the overarching emphasis on multidimensional and complex  challenges, we anticipate aligning research approaches with the planned  initiative strategic framework outcomes. With continuous climate change and  rapid population growth, countries will have to invest even more to feed  their populations.&nbsp; Dryland crops (cereals, legumes, dryland fruit trees,  vegetables) are adapted to these climate variable conditions.&nbsp; While yields  can still improve in some areas in the region within the agroecological  limits in others resilience and stability should be the goal. On the other  hand, yield gaps are an area where improvements will need to come together  with sustainability. The introduction of direct sowing (conservation  agriculture) will also help to reduce yield gaps (<a href='https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31539953'>Bahri et  al., 2019</a>; Frija and Telleria, 2016).&nbsp;   <br>  The above has been provided to indicate the additional consideration  that has been taken in view of the ISDC comments.

It is anticipated that this will help better: (1)  highlight the research problems; (2) align them to the major issues affect  rural development in the Region with supportive macro-level evidence (and  supported by models such as IMPACT and other foresight tools) ; and (3) in so  doing providing a more robust basis for the proposed research and planned  outcomes. The Initiative team will build on the existing foresight studies  (mostly conducted by the centers involved in the initiative) to strengthen,  in a scientific way, the impact of future challenges and drivers of change on  the considered prospects related to the impact priority areas in the region.  A rigorous review of the buzzwords will also be undertaken to ensure they are  situated in a meaningful and coherent way.  <br>  ",

                response: "  The IDT agrees that the analysis of trade-offs and synergies across  impact domains has been lacking. We will add substantive parts for addressing  the issue, by building on existing tools and approaches (developed by the  CGIAR and its partners) to assess trade-offs in dryland farming systems and  guide compromises for their sustainable intensification (see for example  Rekik et al., 2021). The IDT composition has broad disciplinary expertise, in  addition to experience in the Region, that provides the skillset for  identification and quantification of trade-offs and synergies using farming  systems modelling that will be utilized to support the re-organized approach  to this Initiative.   <br>  The CWANA region is one of the “hotspot” regions for climate change,  where ensuring water and land resource extraction remain within planetary  boundaries is critical. Several technological, institutional, market, and policy  innovations have, over the years, been generated, tested, and adapted in  several parts of CWANA that can help in the mitigation and mainly in the  adaptation to climate change and its undesirable social, economic,  biophysical, and environmental impacts. The genetic, agronomic, policy,  institutional, IT innovation packages proposed under this Initiative are  selected to maximize synergies and minimize tradeoffs. All initiative WPs ask  how these innovations perform across all CWANA agro-ecological systems, how  they should be adapted and what impact (positive or negative) there will be  when taking agri-food transitions to scale. Within a region like CWANA, and  as indicated in terms of the significant issues affecting rural development,  there will be impact on socio-economic and environmental conditions, which  are further affected by how this can be facilitated across government  priorities and commitments in each target country. Over the years, the  partner centers for F2R-CWANA have been generated evidence on the factors  that limit large-scale adoption and impacts in the Region, and the short- and  long-term socio-economic, biophysical, and environmental viability of the  technologies that are have been nominated for scaling under F2R (Y<a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s12571-021-01191-7'>igezu et al., 2021a;</a> <a href='https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12640'>Yigezu  and El-Sahter, 2021</a><u>; </u><a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11081465'>El-Shater  and Yigezu, 2021,</a><u> </u><a href='http://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12469.'>Boussios  et al., 2019</a>). An example of this is the following: several  studies in MENA have documented clear synergistic livelihoods, biophysical,  and environmental benefits to Conservation Agriculture (CA) (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.agron.2021.11.001'>Devkota  et al., 2022</a>, <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.105067'>Yigezu et  al., 2021b</a>; <a href='https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aess/2016/6345765/'>Laghrour  et al., 2016</a>; <a href='http://webagris.inra.org.ma/doc/Mrabet011211.pdf'>Mrabet  et al., 2012</a>), one of the technologies to be scaled under  F2R.&nbsp; In the updated F2R-CWANA proposal direct linkage between evidence and  planned innovation will be indicated.  <br>  The projections of beneficiaries and benefits in F2R were based on  past ex-ante and ex-post studies and suitability analysis for different  technologies (Frija et al., 2021). The nature of genetic and technological  innovations proposed under the initiative also infer that there are inherent  trade-offs across the CGIAR impact areas. For example, unlike some targeted  interventions, the genetic and technological innovations proposed under this  initiative are most likely to benefit rural and farming households in the  Region, many of which remain poor. There is an implicit trade-off between  breadth of impact in terms of reducing poverty and reach of these  innovations. Additionally, it should be noted what while some innovations may  be prioritized to young and women, the genetic and technological innovations  proposed under this initiative are likely to benefit broader set of farming  households. In fact, some of the technologies promoted, such as conservation  agriculture, as well as strengthening women’s involvement in decent  employment will accentuate women’s double burden and time property (Beuchelt  and Badstue 2013). We are aware of such trade-offs and they will be mitigated  through simultaneous efforts focused on increased technical innovation (such  as&nbsp; reducing drudgery through mechanization) complemented by&nbsp; crop traits  which help to reduce workload (naked barley and low threshing.. The focus of  WP1 is to identify additional synergies and trade-offs to support the  prioritization of target innovations throughout the Initiative. Key actions  in this WP will be to &nbsp;will explain two essential actor-based/participatory  processes used for addressing the issue of trade-off and synergies: (1) the  process for selecting impact indicators versus five impact domains (productivity,  economic and environmental efficiencies, human and social benefits) and their  prioritization (national/sub-national specific), and (2) the process for  identifying trade-offs and synergies across the five domains. The  actor-based/participatory processes will apply relevant protocol and tools  proposed by the Sustainable Intensification Assessment Framework (Musumba et  al. 2017; among others) that is adopted by CGIAR centers (e.g. CIMMYT). In  WP3, with respect to particular trade-offs and synergies needing proper  quantification, we will additionally add how Integrated Systems Assessment  and Modelling methods will be used for related adoption analysis, ex-post and  ex-ante assessments considering trade-offs.   <br>  In WP4, the WEF Nexus approach provides a rational-systematic  framework that will be applied for analyzing trade-offs across Impact Areas,  by considering the interlinkages between water, energy and food, while  ensuring sustainable use of the related resources and ecosystem services.  This is to be achieved by improving the use of water, energy and  soil-enhancing fertilizers to maximize food production, and meeting the needs  of the harsh climate conditions of the MENA region, providing opportunities  for productive agriculture and improving the livelihood and income of farmers  (Fuglie et al. 2021). WP4 will develop innovation tools, such as  Tele-irrigation and irrigation technologies devices, which allow remote  control of water and fertilizers management and coping with the impacts of  climate change. Farmers shall be exposed to these applications and tools.  Nexus Eco-Digital Demonstration Farms would serve as a demonstration raising  farmers' awareness of water energy, and fertilizers- efficiency, ensuring  that the relative communities will ultimately benefit from the tools, data,  and knowledge developed across the region.   <br>  ",

                response: "  To improve clarity, we will re-focus the ToC based on work-package  integration. A data-driven and multi-stakeholder-consultive approach  underlines actions towards validation of technological packages, and adoption  and scaling to achieve resilience. Building on CRP legacy and lessons learned  and through the promotion of integration and two-way synergies between  F2R-CWANA and the&nbsp; Global Initiatives. The Initiative will create in the  primary target countries multi-stakeholder fora (National Alliance of Stakeholder)  to discuss, assess, and prioritize technologies and enabling policies. The  technologies will be then tested, validated and packed in Innovation  Platforms, physical “Living Labs” situated on the ground in the  agro-ecologies, and communities, and partnership networks that are necessary  to enable testing of technologies, tools, approaches, and ultimately  Innovations. CRP legacy technologies, Global Innovation initiatives packages  and third-party innovations are then selected adapted to the region, and scaled.  One evidence for success will be the promotion of direct sowing in Morocco  where the drivers of the CWANA Initiative have been developed in the last  years. Morocco is increasingly confronted with a  water deficit caused  by a  structural drought, the adoption and deployment of adaptation  approaches combining cultivation  techniques and combining cultivation techniques and practices  to better  value the drop  of water,  is an  essential orientation of the  Generation Green strategy.  As a result of scientific evidence and a multi-stakeholder consultive  approach, by 2030, the  objective of the national  program for the  promotion of direct  sowing aims to  gradually increase the  area to reach  1 million  hectares of cereals  in direct  sowing, starting from  an area  of less  than 30,000 ha  currently. Financial support for this  specific Government of Morocco initiative will&nbsp; come from relevant  ministries, public and private partnerships while at the same time linking  into the proposed work for F2R-CWANA.   <br>  The challenge in the development of the RII, from the  perspective of F2R-CWANA, are the important links that must be made across  the Global Initiatives. As articulated above and noted throughout the review  provided, additional attention will be focused on linking the Initiative more  strongly to and across Impact Areas and the interconnections across Global  Initiatives. Due to both the shape of the Initiative within the wider CGIAR  Portfolio and as convening mechanism across the Global Initiatives in  addition to the way these should have interconnections, further robustness to  F2R-CWANA will be possible. This will be further underlined by increased  overall view of strengthening views on trade-offs, prioritization, and  integrating feedback loops.  We will capitalize CGIAR  system science implemented in System Programs until 2016 and later  mainstreamed in Agri-food system ones (2017-2021)CAS Secretariat,&nbsp;  2021). The initiative will  sustain other program theory of changes and provide feedback loop to avoid  duplications among them. Overall system research will be implemented along 7  key steps:&nbsp;(1) focus on complex social-ecological systems and livelihood  portfolios (farming systems and crop productions are essential parts of  them); (2) explicit consideration of trade-offs among multiple expected  impact areas (improving productivity, reducing risk, and social, economic and  environmental sustainability), targets multiple wins where possible, balances  trade-offs where not; (3) attention to interactions between system components  with considering externalities and vulnerabilities; (4) broader focus on  innovations and investments that respond to interactions between multiple  drivers of change across contexts and scales; (5) facilitate scaling up and  out; (6) interdisciplinary (not only among science disciplines, but also  between scientific and indigenous knowledge) and improving local ownership of  development pathways, and (7) engage and empower disadvantaged groups  in&nbsp; the research process.  <br>  ",

In  working with the countries and under the patronage of CORAF, our initiative  will be able to tap into technical assistance grants offered by some of the  member countries that are eligible for World Bank (WB), African Development Bank  (AfDB), Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) and the Rome Based UN agencies (IFAD,  FAO and WFP) for support.&nbsp; Further, the Initiative will align its activities  to national agricultural frameworks and sector development programs: in  Nigeria, for instance, the Agricultural Transformation Support Agenda Phase 1  has the same vision as TAFS-WCA, and so engaging with actors at federal and  state levels, will enhance the buy -in, institutionalization and financial  attraction of more investments for the wider area. A participatory approach  will serve to ensure ownership by the involved parties’ various levels where  sustained funding beyond the program life are assured.  ",

                response: "  This question is likely to  reverberate across various Regional Integrated Initiatives. For example,  capacity building support to national/local research bodies has to a large  extent been wanting, which is evidenced in relative underfunding and  inadequacy of research capacity to respond to complex and emerging knowledge  and information demands at national levels.   <br>  At sub-regional level, the  Initiative Team will work with CORAF as a member of the management team. CORAF  has designated national centers of specialization and regional centers of  excellence within the national agricultural research systems to raise the  efficiency and effectiveness of resource utilization in agricultural R&amp;D  and to assure the requisite capacity needs. The Initiative will be able to  rely on CORAF information and assessment how these activities will be able to  bridge the gap.&nbsp;   <br>  <br>  At regional level, the  Initiative Team is working with colleagues of the U2 – ESA Initiative to look  into other Research for Development Platforms / capacity building (such as  Pan African Alliance for Bean Research) and policy platforms that are in a  privileged position to establish capacity needs and development capacity  building plans to bridge the R4D gap in the region.  <br>  Initially, efforts will focus  on consolidating the relevant training materials, tools and approach  descriptions from the implementing partners on the initiative and working  towards having digital versions of these instruments available in a common  location in coordination with the concept of creating a One CGIAR Academy.&nbsp;   ",
