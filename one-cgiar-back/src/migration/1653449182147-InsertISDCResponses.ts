Examples to be\n  re-emphasized and further developed include planned research and evaluation\n  on: seed quality regulations that introduce farmer-focused standards to allow\n  cooperatives and entrepreneurs to scale-up their seed production activities\n  to support new communities and markets; variety release procedures that\n  recognize and valorize farmer varieties; and capacity development programs\n  targeted to women and youth entrepreneurs. Additional activities will be described\n  in the plan of work and budget to be developed to include aspects that\n  improve outcomes for gender and youth through equitable seed systems\n  including farmer-based seed systems. In particular a greater emphasis will be\n  placed on achieving these outcomes through engaging a wider range of&nbsp; public\n  and private sector research and development actors and using&nbsp;\n  socially-inclusive and gender-transformative strategies to enhance inclusive\n  access to seed, improving synergies between formal and informal systems so\n  that women and men from vulnerable and disadvantaged socio-economic groups\n  will be able to use affordable and good quality seed of the crops and\n  varieties they prefer accessed timely through convenient delivery channels to\n  enhance their crop productivity and, consequently contribute to their food\n  security, resilient livelihoods and incomes. Due to enhanced awareness and\n  access to information on new varieties and seeds, they will be able to demand\n  and source seed as required. As these groups have traditionally relied on\n  informal sources, the co-ordination between formal and informal systems will\n  be enhanced to improve their access to seed of more diverse crops and\n  varieties. This strategy will also enable these communities to better respond\n  to changing climatic conditions as also pointed out by the ISDC review. Women\n  have traditionally played a central role in community-based or farmer-managed\n  seeds systems. Better Linking them to the capacity development and engagement\n  activities of the initiative (women and youth in seed production and\n  marketing individually or through their collectives) will lead to their\n  economic empowerment and consequently better livelihoods and better social\n  status, seed-confidence and self-esteem. Women have traditionally played a central\n  role in community-based or farmer-managed seeds systems. Linking these to the\n  formal systems and seed supply chains can enhance their visibility, economic\n  returns and empowerment. All this will be supported by a gender-responsive\n  seed policy and enabling environment. </p>\n  <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal\">Lastly\n  additional partnerships will be sought or strengthened to enhance our\n  capability to better integrate formal and Informal (farmer-based) seed\n  systems. The existing relationship with the CDI team at Wageningen University\n  will be strengthened to apply their knowledge and experience in integrated\n  seed sector development and links will be sought with the allied seed sector\n  development projects with a comparative advantage in this area such as the\n  important USAID funded and CRS led S34D project. The well regarded CGIAR-led\n  Seed System Community of Excellence, which has championed the importance of\n  an integrated approach, and empathizing the importance of farmer based seeds\n  systems and farmers rights will be given the role of guiding the initiative\n  in developing actionable interventions that promote equity and inclusive\n  access to seed.

As an example, the\n  foundation seed company and SeEdQUAL partner <i>Qualibasics</i> will have 184\n  MT of maize, bean and soy foundation seed available in 2022. Predominantly\n  CGIAR-bred and carrying drought, heat, low-N and disease resistance,\n  certified seed produced from this seed will be sufficient to plant 1.1 MM ha\n  (to be planted by more than 2 MM small-holder farmers) working through 58\n  further seed multipliers in 12 target countries. The initiative will seek to\n  engage with further such entities in both SSA and Asia.</p>\n  <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal\">The review is\n  correct that 2022 represents an inception year and where benefits accruing\n  from the proposed seed delivery innovations cannot begin to accrue until the\n  following year and thus the three-year investment not realized until 2025.\n  This will be made clearer in results tables to be developed and agreed during\n  the development of plan and work and budgets during Q1 year 1. More detailed\n  estimates of projected benefits will also be calculated based on the detailed\n  plan of work and budget (included the proposed extended initiative\n  partnership approach) and made available during 2022 and the underlying\n  assumptions better presented. </p>\n  ",
